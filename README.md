# UFOs

## Project Overview

 The purpose of this project is to utilize JavaScript in order to create a website that contains a table that organizes UFO sightings from all over the world.  The table was created in JavaScript to allow for filtering of the table by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

 The website uses a filter system in order for the user to search for UFO sightings based on specific data criteria.  The search filter shown below has placeholder values to give the user an example of the type of keywords/data that can be searched.

 Once the user has entered the search filter criteria they are looking for and pressed enter on their keyboard, the table will display only the information obtained through the filter process.  In the example below, the table was filtered to only display UFO data for sightings that occurred in North Carolina.

 If the user wants to change the search criteria, they simply delete the previous filter and type in the new information they are looking for.

## Summary

 One drawback to this filter table is the lack of a "return results" or "search" button on the webpage.  If the user does not know to press the "enter" key on their keyboard, the table will not filter and return the results.  

 This website can be improved by adding a "return results" button as described above.  This would improve the user experience by making the website more intuitive.
 This website could also be improved by linking the table data with a live webpage that would add new data without needing to go into the data.js file and append the json file manually.
